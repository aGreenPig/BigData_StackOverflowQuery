# Stack Overflow Natural Language Query Challege

Googling-StackOverflow is humorous name for a development technique that
consists in Googling every programming task to find StackOverflow snippets of
code for it. Google queries are usually written in Natural Language, therefore it
should be interesting to explore how much we can program in Natural Language,
given a large database that links Natural Language titles with code snippets such
as StackOverflow.
Another advantage of the database is that answers are voted, meaning that
is possible to evaluate what are the best snippets. This can be used to the
advantage of the recommendation system.

The full data dump for StackOverflow can be found at:

Kaggle Provides an older version that includes only Python answers here:
https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions/data
Examples of Queries to this dataset can be found here:
http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries

Specifically, this final project requires you and your team to develop
a recommendation system that given a list Natural Language statements,
return a list of python snippets.
